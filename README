My Emacs Configuration
----------------------

This is my emacs setup, and probably of interest to nobody but me.

Very recently, I've upgraded from emacs 23 to emacs 24, and with it
I'm trying a el-get package management setup. This is significantly
different to how I've worked in the past, but I'm willing to change
with the times.

I have set things up so that all installed el-get packages are ignored
by git, so each machine I clone my .emacs.d directory to will have to
bootstrap el-get and its packages on first install. I think I'm fine
with that.

The only caveat is that so far, the el-get bootstrap process seems
pretty flakey. On both machines I've tried it on, I've had to restart
emacs several times to get all the packages installed. This should
therefore be considered a work in progress.

It's a brave new world.
